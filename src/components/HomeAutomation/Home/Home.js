          <p id="ans">
            you can put your lights on schedules so that they turn off when you
            normally go to sleep, or you can have your thermostat turn the A/C
            up about an hour before you return to work so you donâ€™t have to
            return to a stuffy house. Home automation makes life more convenient
            and can even save you money on heating, cooling and electricity
            bills.
